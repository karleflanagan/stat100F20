              <p style="padding-top: 2em;">Hi everyone! My name is Karle and I'm one of the stat 100 instructors. I've always loved math, statistics, and education. Teaching stat 100 is the perfect job for me since I can help students from many different majors gain an appreciation for all 3.<br /><br /> A few other things about me: I'm a huge Illini fan- I went to school at UIUC, met my husband at UIUC, and now I work here. U of I is one of my favorite places in the world! I also enjoy spending time outside, playing piano, water skiing, snow skiing, and traveling.</p>

              <p style="padding-top: 2em;">Hello my name is Atharv Pathak and I'm a junior in Statistics and Aerospace Engineer! I really loved Stat 200, which is why I decided to become a TA for Stat 100. In addition to being a TA for this class, I am also a CA for a Stat 200 class in data science, so if you have any questions about the course I would love to answer them! A little about me: I am a huge football fan (I love the Cincinnati Bengals), I like working out and I love Chicago rap!</p>

When I took STAT 100 as a freshman, I discovered a new interest in statistics and wanted to join the STAT 100 team! I am a huge Chicago Cubs fan, and I think it would be interesting to have a career in sport psychology and involve statistics. In my free time, I am on the Illinois Rowing Club team and enjoy reading and exercising. A fun fact is that I like trying different coffee shops on campus to keep up with my iced coffee obsession!</p>
