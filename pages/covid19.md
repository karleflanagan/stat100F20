Hi Everyone,

I hope you're enjoying spring break as much as you can, given everything that's been going on lately!  We wanted to share with you how we are planning to transition Stat 100 to be fully online after spring break. Here is a breakdown of what will happen to each course component:

 * **Lectures:** We will not be holding synchronous lectures at our normal class time. Instead, we will post lecture videos to <a href="https://compass2g.illinois.edu/" target="\_blank">Compass</a> for you to watch at a time that's convenient for you (if you are in the online section, this is what you normally have been doing!). Fortunately, we do have lectures from previous semesters that we can always use. The other Stat 100 instructor (Kelly) and I are also hoping to re-film at least a few videos this semester in order to help keep things fresh and authentic for you if we can! The lecture videos will be posted to our Compass page before the regularly scheduled lecture would have taken place so that you can stay on pace and choose to watch the videos at the same time as our class (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11am) if you'd like.  

 * **iClickers:** If you are enrolled in the in-person section (L2), then we will simply take the iClicker points you have now as counting for the entire semester. This will most likely be to your advantage since we will still drop 2 days even though we had only half as many iClicker days as a normal semester.

 * **Completed Notebook:** We normally offer extra credit for completely filled in notebooks at the final exam. Right now, we are re-evaluating what to do about this since we will remain online for the rest of the semester. In the meantime, we‚Äôd HIGHLY encourage you to continue filling in the notebook!  This will make the online lectures a lot more engaging and meaningful üòäIt's best to actively engage with the lecture videos, rather than passively watching!

 * **Lon Capa Assignments:** Luckily, these are already online!  There will be no change to our regularly scheduled HW Assignments, Bonus Pre-Lecture Videos, and Bonus Surveys. Our <a href="https://karleflanagan.github.io/stat100S20/pages/calendar.html" target="\_blank">course calendar</a> is completely trustworthy and correct üòä

 * **Exams:** We are planning to do exams on <a href="https://lon-capa.illinois.edu" target="\_blank">Lon Capa</a>, since you will already be familiar with that interface for Homework. Since we can‚Äôt proctor the exams in person, we have tentatively decided that it seems most fair to just make them open book for everyone, but it is on your honor that they are not ‚Äúopen person‚Äù‚Äîyour answers should still be your answers and you should not work with anyone on the exams. These exams will be open for a specific and limited period of time, much like if you were to take them in person. We will also offer conflict times to students who sign up, and we will offer extended time exams specifically for students with DRES letters including that accommodation.  We will send more information on this as the time gets closer.  Exam dates for exam 3 and the final are still the same and posted on our website <a href="https://karleflanagan.github.io/stat100S20/pages/exam_schedule.html" target="\_blank">here</a>.

 * **Office Hours:** We will hold Zoom Office Hours regularly throughout each week. Right now, our plan is to hold office hours as usual from 2-4pm every day over Zoom, but we will discuss with our team to weigh whether alternative times might be needed based on schedules and time zone changes for anyone going home. We will provide Zoom links to join the office hour time on Compass starting March 23rd.  All you will need to do is click the link and select the pop-up options. Zoom has a chat feature, share screen option, raise hand option, and many other helpful features. We can even split our Zoom session into multiple ‚Äúbreak out rooms‚Äù if we have a lot of students joining with questions.  I'll be at most of these office hours too! I want to be there for you guys as much as I can!

Thank you for your patience as we figure things out! Fortunately, we think Stat 100 should have a fairly straightforward transition, and while we will deeply miss seeing you all every week, we are hopeful that we can continue to interact with many of you on Zoom and offer you the best instruction and assistance we can üòäThanks again!

-Karle Flanagan, Kelly Findley, and The Stat 100 Team
